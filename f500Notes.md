# establishing and maintaining credibility in the workplace
Develop a reputation for being predictable, knowledgeable, and easy to work with.  Show a basic respect for your colleagues who work alongside you, and an academic interest in adjacent domains.  Be clear in your requests and expectations of your colleagues.  When discussing a peer's domain, use their domain-specific lingo.  When discussing your domain, always begin with a first-principles overview, explicitly defining domain-specific terminology. 

Be mindful of your credibility in the workplace; what areas you are authoritative, advisory etc. Always have concrete, actionable deliverables when acting in an advisory role

Practice System 2 thinking frequently;  you do not always need to share the process, but you can use them in group or 1:1 environments to ensure that others have input into your analysis. 

Unreasoned opinions destroy credibility silently.   Any opinion should carry exec-ready backing analysis commensurate to its impact, or it should expressed as a question. Always identify the conditions and indicators that contraindicate your analysis. 

It is vanishingly rare to receive active feedback on incidents that damage your credibility in the workplace. It is much more common for people to exit an interaction thinking they’ve won an argument when in fact they’ve only identified themselves as an obstacle to be worked around (or removed entirely). Being retrospective and open, leaving room to be wrong.  Actively seek out feedback from everyone you work with closely.  Be specific in your request for feedback - anything you want me to stop, start or continue doing.


### Managing conflict
Conflict is natural, necessary, and healthy in knowledge worker roles, but can be organizationally paralytic and personally off-putting.  This is solved with transparency and documentation.

When managing conflict with a peer, draw a network diagram of the workflow and document:
- RACI - if it does not exist, create one and agree on it.  If you cannot agree on it, consult your manager
- Areas of agreement
- Areas of conflict 
- Escalation paths
- Escalation timing

With those established, use **the entire time available to you** in order to resolve differences, as long as you are making progress

### Managing ambiguity
Accounting for unknowns is a core aspect of analytic method and necessary for all management personnel, and most senior ICs.  Inability to account for ambiguity is immediately obvious to executives.



# choosing an industry
## 1. Tech Product firms
### Large firms (FAANG, HPE, Alibaba, Dell, etc)
Entry into large tech product firms is usually directly out of undergrad or graduate level intern programs.  Lateral entrants will usually come into the firm through the field (sales/service) or from acquisitions.  There is increasingly lower optionality for geography in large firms.  Laterals tend to hit glass ceilings at or around the executive level, but mid-senior IC and manager roles can be quite comfortable and stable.

### Mid-sized firms (Rubrik, NetApp, Pure, Veritas, etc)
Mid-late startups, pre-IPO and mid-sized tech firms in high growth phase represent the greatest opportunity for mid-junior technologists, particularly in field-facing roles, which tend to be more valued in smaller firms. They generally offer the least optionality in terms work-life balance, but high growth gives opportunity across geographies, and competitive pay ranges.  High performing laterals will have equitable access to executive positions, which can be parlayed to executive scope in a large firm.

### Small firms 
These startups are generally low pay and highly volatile, but offer unparalleled technical exposure.  Junior laterals can get early leadership and decision-making experience, while retaining and expanding technical depth.

## 2. Consulting/MSP/Reseller/Distributor
The smallest firsm will focus on one area, but firms with 100+ personnel will generally feature "practices", each directed by largely autonomous business leaders who will determine the work culture.  There is opportunity across experience levels.  Mid-juniors with a history of high performance in this space are attractive to tech product firms as this is where their native recruiting class starts to wash out.

### Operations and Delivery
Junior laterals will find the most opportunity in operations/delivery roles, which also tend to be more geographically distributed.  These are excellent roles to get deep and broad experience, but tend to be lower paid because costs are passed more or less directly to the user.  Senior roles tend to be unpleasant, owing to the constant pressure to optimize.  People looking to maximize earnings and stability in later career phases will get their 10k hours and move on.

### Business and Offer Development
These are some of the most satisfying roles for a broadly interested technologist.  Even juniors can have extensive influence on technology stack and development pattern choices.

## 3. End user
End user firms will employ technologists to serve two functions:

### Enable key differentiators

### Support Operations
