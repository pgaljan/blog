# establishing and maintaining credibility in the workplace
Develop a reputation for being predictable, knowledgeable, and easy to work with.  Show a basic respect for your colleagues who work alongside you, and an academic interest in adjacent domains.  Be clear in your requests and expectations of your colleagues.  When discussing a peer's domain, use their domain-specific lingo.  When discussing your domain, always begin with a first-principles overview, explicitly defining domain-specific terminology. 

Be mindful of your credibility in the workplace; what areas you are authoritative, advisory etc. Always have concrete, actionable deliverables when acting in an advisory role

Practice System 2 thinking frequently;  you do not always need to share the process, but you can use them in group or 1:1 environments to ensure that others have input into your analysis. 

Unreasoned opinions destroy credibility silently.   Any opinion should carry exec-ready backing analysis commensurate to its impact, or it should expressed as a question. Always identify the conditions and indicators that contraindicate your analysis. 

It is vanishingly rare to receive active feedback on incidents that damage your credibility in the workplace. It is much more common for people to exit an interaction thinking they’ve won an argument when in fact they’ve only identified themselves as an obstacle to be worked around (or removed entirely). Being retrospective and open, leaving room to be wrong, and actively seeking feedback from all classes of stakeholder are all critical .

## learn to manage conflict and ambiguity

### Managing conflict
Conflict is natural, necessary, and healthy in knowledge worker roles, but can be organizationally paralytic and personally off-putting.  This is solved with transparency and documentation.

When managing conflict with a peer, draw a network diagram of the workflow and document:
- RACI - if it does not exist, create one and agree on it.  If you cannot agree on it, consult your manager
- Areas of agreement
- Areas of conflict 
- Escalation paths
- Escalation timing

With those established, use **the entire time available to you** in order to resolve differences, as long as you are making progress

### Managing ambiguity
Accounting for unknowns is a core aspect of analytic method.  Inability to account for ambiguity will stall your career.

# manage career progression

## understand your career ladder
Most companies have a tech ladder, even if it's only one or two steps.  Domain-focused IC roles that can overlap with relatively senior managers from a compensation perspective.  Progression to the very top IC ranks is statistically rare.  

Given the compensation overlap, it's common for a person move back and forth between management and IC although it's not always successful; great engineers often make bad managers, and it's easy for managers to lose technical depth.  

| IC                       | Manager                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
|                          | Executive              |
| Fellow                   | SVP                    |
| Distinguished            | VP                     |
| Sr. Architect / Sr. Engr | Director / Sr Director |
| Advisor / Sr Advisor     | Manager / Sr Manager   |
| Early career             |                        |

## choose an industry
A technologist can work in one of three general types of organizations, roughly representing the technology supply chain.

Pay for the same applied skill varies widely in tech for two reasons:

- Industries value talent based on ROI of the applied skillset, which varies according to application
- Tech is notoriously high leverage; decisions a single worker makes can save (or cost) the organization many times the price of the worker themselves.

Because pay varies widely, jobs in tech are frequently tuned to optimize for work/life flexibility, particularly in industries where pay is uncompetitive.

Industry tailwinds are very helpful for entry level jobs, but being part of a "hot industry" makes progression more competitive. Industry headwinds present opportunities for mid-career leaders because tech is nearly always challenged to innovate when cost optimizations are in play.  

Study your industry, adjacent industries, and adjacent geographies, understand where money is being invested.  Read trade publications and quarterly reports of firms you are interested in.

*Exercise*: Assess developments in your functional area over the last five years and do an impact assessment on your skill set 

## develop a goal
Identify a specific job that meets your criteria as "ideal" for you in five years.  If you have no specific job in mind, set a specific total comp and find jobs aligned to those earnings.  It does not need to include management, but should represent a substantial scope change from what you do today. 

*exercise*:
“In <year>, I would like to be <title> of <domain> in an <sized>-sized firm in the <industry> industry in the <location> metro area , earning <range>, with a <number> span of control over <number> levels.”

It should be aggressive but realistic, accounting for geography, current access, experience, and the time you are realistically able to commit to career development.   For example a high performing mid-career target hire might be able to achieve Director-level management in 5 years, where the same lateral hire might take 8-10 to achieve the same.

Get very specific, and look up listings for the exact job you want, and closely evaluate the hiring criteria.   Perform a gap analysis, and check your assumptions to make sure it's still aggressive but realistic.  

Pay special attention to market- and role-specific proof points.  For example, a global leader will need prior international experience, and a junior exec with multiple L1 managers will need to show strong performance as a direct manager.

## develop a plan
Create a skills matrix showing the up-and downstream consumers of your function and assess your skills in each of these areas on a 100 to 400-level depth. 

Start working the gaps:
- Access
- Technical experience
- Adjacent domain fluency
- Reputation
- Network
- Education

Do this exercise fresh every 6-12 months, like visiting your financial plan.

## maintain career agility
Average job tenure is 2-4 years and this holds true for your manager as well. Do not rely on your relationship with your manager for promotion or even job security. Establish and maintain your own reputation for producing predictable, excellent deliverables, on time, with transparency to process.

Document your tasks until they are portable. If you cannot adequately engage a peer and have them do your work, keep documenting
*if you cannot hand over your work, you will be doing it until you quit or are fired*

Actively seek out feedback from everyone you work with closely.  Be specific in your request for feedback - anything you want me to stop, start or continue doing.

Join, attend, and present at meetups/user groups for your space.  Talk to the attendees more than the vendors.   Find mentors in your space; discussions should be 3:1 in favor of mentor sharing experience vs seeking advice.  

# choosing an industry
## 1. Tech Product firms
### Large firms (FAANG, HPE, Alibaba, Dell, etc)
Entry into large tech product firms is usually directly out of undergrad or graduate level intern programs.  Lateral entrants will usually come into the firm through the field (sales/service) or from acquisitions.  There is increasingly lower optionality for geography in large firms.  Laterals tend to hit glass ceilings at or around the executive level, but mid-senior IC and manager roles can be quite comfortable and stable.

### Mid-sized firms (Rubrik, NetApp, Pure, Veritas, etc)
Mid-late startups, pre-IPO and mid-sized tech firms in high growth phase represent the greatest opportunity for mid-junior technologists, particularly in field-facing roles, which tend to be more valued in smaller firms. They generally offer the least optionality in terms work-life balance, but high growth gives opportunity across geographies, and competitive pay ranges.  High performing laterals will have equitable access to executive positions, which can be parlayed to executive scope in a large firm.

### Small firms 
These startups are generally low pay and highly volatile, but offer unparalleled technical exposure.  Junior laterals can get early leadership and decision-making experience, while retaining and expanding technical depth.

## 2. Consulting/MSP/Reseller/Distributor
The smallest firsm will focus on one area, but firms with 100+ personnel will generally feature "practices", each directed by largely autonomous business leaders who will determine the work culture.  There is opportunity across experience levels.  Mid-juniors with a history of high performance in this space are attractive to tech product firms as this is where their native recruiting class starts to wash out.

### Operations and Delivery
Junior laterals will find the most opportunity in operations/delivery roles, which also tend to be more geographically distributed.  These are excellent roles to get deep and broad experience, but tend to be lower paid because costs are passed more or less directly to the user.  Senior roles tend to be unpleasant, owing to the constant pressure to optimize.  People looking to maximize earnings and stability in later career phases will get their 10k hours and move on.

### Business and Offer Development
These are some of the most satisfying roles for a broadly interested technologist.  Even juniors can have extensive influence on technology stack and development pattern choices.

## 3. End user
End user firms will employ technologist/analysts to serve two functions:

### Enable key differentiators

### Support Operations






## Time in Role
1. Ideal time in role 2-3 years (for you; org may prefer longer)
2. If you do not honestly see a progression path after 18 months, it's time to start looking.  
3. Do not hold any job without a scope change for more than 5 years (particularly true in F500).

<code>Don't take a job without knowing how it will position you for the next role</code>

## Pay structure
At entry/junior levels, total compensation is mostly base pay, with a 10-15% target bonus.  Senior ICs will see that rise to 25% and will be much higher as you move up mid- and senior- management.  

Sell enough stock to cover gains and income tax immediately on grant. If the stock price falls you are exposed to a tax bills without the corresponding assets to cover.
