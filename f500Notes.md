## networking, marketing, soft skills
Develop a reputation for being predictable, knowledgeable, and easy to work with.  Show a basic respect for your colleagues who work alongside you, and an academic interest in adjacent domains.  Be clear in your requests and expectations of your colleagues, using their domain-specific lingo.  When discussing your domain, always begin with a first-principles overview, avoiding domain-specific terminology. 

Actively seek out feedback from everyone you work with closely.  Be specific in your request for feedback - anything you want me to stop, start or continue doing.

Join, attend, and present at meetups/user groups for your space.  Talk to the attendees more than the vendors.   Find mentors in your space; discussions should be 3:1 in favor of mentor sharing experience vs seeking advice.  

*Exercise*:  Maintain a blog or github that shows your current interests, skill levels, and development patterns. If you can't commit the time to an active blog or github, polish and publish some work on carrd as a one-off.

# develop organizational awareness

## understand the structure 
Review the org chart, use it to document a [directed graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph) network in whatever tool you prefer

## understand your understanding of your network
Centering yourself in the network
- rate your academic understanding of all nodes on a 100 to 400 academic level
- rate your organizational understanding of all nodes on a normal scale

## Close gaps/maintain academic understanding
- Maintain a 100 level understanding on all identifiable nodes on your network
- Maintain a 400 level on all connecting nodes.
- Maintain 500 level on your node.  To claim status as a knowledge worker, you must operate post-graduate experience in your domain.  The actual degree is optional; but you should maintain a demonstrable external facing portfolio or level of certification commensurate to your title.

## maintain your own agility
Average job tenure is 2-4 years and this holds true for your manager as well. Do not rely on your relationship with them for promotion or even job security. Establish and maintain your own reputation for producing predictable, excellent deliverables, on time, with transparency to process.

Document your tasks until they are portable. If you cannot adequately engage a peer and have them do your work, keep documenting
*if you cannot hand over your work, you will be doing it until you quit or are fired*

*exercise*: Write a transition plan for your role

## establish/maintain credibility
Be mindful of your credibility in the workplace; what areas you are authoritative, advisory etc. Maximize advisory functions, with advisory roles being active work, and not just review/editing of other work; this is work you should be claiming ownership of. 

*exercise*:  Using the functional organizational map, mark the functions where you are authoritative, advisory, informed, or ignorant.

Practice System 2 thinking frequently;  you do not always need to share the process, but you can use them in group or 1:1 environments to ensure that others have input into your analysis. 

Don’t express unreasoned opinions in the workplace - Chesterton fences destroy credibility silently and quickly.   All opinions should carry exec-ready backing analysis or be expressed as a question; casual opinions do not belong in the workplace. Always identify the conditions and indicators that contraindicate your analysis. 

It is vanishingly rare to receive active feedback on incidents that damage your credibility in the workplace. It is much more common for people to exit an interaction thinking they’ve won an argument when in fact they’ve only identified themselves as an obstacle to be worked around (or removed entirely). So be retrospective, leave room to be wrong, and actively seek feedback from all classes of stakeholder.

## conflict management
Conflict is necessary and healthy. When managing conflict with a peer, identify and document:
- RACI - if it does not exist, create one and agree on it.  If you cannot agree on it, consult your manager
- Areas of agreement
- Areas of conflict 
- Escalation timing
- Escalation paths

# understand your career ladder
Most companies have a tech ladder, even if it's only one or two steps.  In more tech-focused companies, IC roles that can overlap with relatively senior managers from a compensation perspective.  Progression to the very top IC ranks is statistically rare.  

Given the compensation overlap, it's common for a person move back and forth between management and IC although it's not always successful; great engineers often make bad managers, and it's easy for managers to lose technical depth.  

| IC                       | Manager                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
|                          | Executive              |
| Fellow                   | SVP                    |
| Distinguished            | VP                     |
| Sr. Architect / Sr. Engr | Director / Sr Director |
| Advisor / Sr Advisor     | Manager / Sr Manager   |

## choose an industry
A technologist can work in one of three general types of organizations, roughly representing the technology supply chain.

Pay for the same applied skill varies widely in tech for two reasons:

- Industries value talent based on ROI of the applied skillset, which varies according to application
- Tech is notoriously high leverage; decisions a single worker makes can save (or cost) the organization many times the price of the worker themselves.

Because pay varies widely, jobs in tech are frequently tuned to optimize for work/life flexibility, particularly in industries where pay is uncompetitive.

Industry tailwinds are very helpful for entry level jobs, but being part of a "hot industry" makes progression more competitive. Industry headwinds present opportunities for mid-career leaders because tech is nearly always challenged to innovate when cost optimizations are in play.  

Study your industry, adjacent industries, and adjacent geographies, understand where money is being invested.  Read trade publications and quarterly reports of firms you are interested in.

*Exercise*: Assess developments in your functional area over the last five years and do an impact assessment on your skill set 

### develop a goal
Identify a specific job that meets your criteria as "ideal" for you in five years.  If you have no specific job in mind, set a specific total comp and find jobs aligned to those earnings.  It does not need to include management, but should represent a substantial scope change from what you do today. 

*exercise*:
“In <year>, I would like to be <title> of <domain> in an <sized>-sized firm in the <industry> industry in the <location> metro area , earning <range>, with a <number> span of control over <number> levels.”

It should be aggressive but realistic, accounting for geography, current access, experience, and the time you are realistically able to commit to career development.   For example a high performing mid-career target hire might be able to achieve Director-level management in 5 years, where the same lateral hire might take 8-10 to achieve the same.

Get very specific, and look up listings for the exact job you want, and closely evaluate the hiring criteria.   Perform a gap analysis, and check your assumptions to make sure it's still aggressive but realistic.  

Pay special attention to market- and role-specific proof points.  For example, a global leader will need prior international experience, and a junior exec with multiple L1 managers will need to show strong performance as a direct manager.

### develop a plan
Create a skills matrix showing the up-and downstream consumers of your function and assess your skills in each of these areas on a 100 to 400-level depth. 

Start working the gaps:
- Access
- Technical experience
- Adjacent domain fluency
- Reputation
- Network
- Education

Do this exercise fresh every 6-12 months, like visiting your financial plan.


### 1. Tech Product firms
#### Large firms
Entry into large tech product firms is generally done directly out of undergrad or master's level studies through intern programs, and once in, lateral movement between firms is common.  Later-career entrants will usually come into the firm through the field or from acquisitions.  There is increasingly lower optionality for geography.  Laterals tend to hit glass ceilings at or around the executive level, but mid-senior IC and manager roles can be quite comfortable and stable.

#### Mid-sized firms
Mid-late startups and pre-IPO firms in high growth phase represent the greatest opportunity for mid-junior technologists, particularly in field-facing roles. This tends to be the frothiest area, and gives the least optionality in terms work-life balance.

### 2. Consulting/MSP/Reseller/Distributor


### 3. End user


	1. Technology-based optimizations
	2. Operational Technology Support





## Time in Role
1. Ideal time in role 2-3 years (for you; org may prefer longer)
2. If you do not honestly see a progression path after 18 months, it's time to start looking.  
3. Do not hold any job without a scope change for more than 5 years (particularly true in F500).

<code>Don't take a job without knowing how it will position you for the next role</code>

## Pay structure
At entry/junior levels, total compensation is mostly base pay, with a 10-15% target bonus.  Senior ICs will see that rise to 25% and will be much higher as you move up mid- and senior- management.  

Sell enough stock to cover gains and income tax immediately on grant. If the stock price falls you are exposed to a tax bills without the corresponding assets to cover.
