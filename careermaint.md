## maintain career agility
Average job tenure is 2-4 years and this holds true for your manager as well. Establish and maintain your own reputation for producing predictable, excellent deliverables, on time, with transparency to process.  A 2-4 year job cycle requires that you *maintain an active, documented offboarding plan* that allows you to transition your core responsibilities within 4 weeks. If you cannot hand over your work, you will be doing it until you quit or are fired.

*Join, attend, and present at meetups/user groups for your space.*  Talk to the attendees more than the vendors.   Find and develop relationships with mentors in your space; discussions should be 3:1 in favor of mentor sharing experience vs seeking advice.  

*How does your current role prepare you for your next two roles?*

## maintain your skills and develop perspective
Dedicate 10-20 hours per month learning portable skills, tools, or frameworks related to your core competency.  Dedicate 5-10 hours per month to educating yourself on business topics such as finance, strategic analysis, supply chain, personnel management, etc.

## manage your earnings
The value of any skill depends on the market value of its outcome, which is subject to automation in tech/knowledge worker roles.  High-comp operational positions are systematically targeted and productized out of existence, often gradually, sometimes quite suddenly.  Do not spend to your earnings and maintain 6-12 months of opex relatively liquid to cover expenditures during a re-tooling.  This is much easier to achieve when you limit your future-obligated spending to less than half your net.  High levels of future-obligated spend reduces employment optionality, which can have substantial long-term impact on overall career earnings and satisfaction.

Know the OTE pay structure for your role and those in your tech ladder.  In corporate roles  at entry/junior levels, total compensation is mostly base pay with a 10-15% target bonus.  Senior ICs will see that rise to 25% and senior management may see 40%+.  Bonuses are a financial instrument that ties compensation to some key corporate KPI (often a blend of revenue/margin).   They do not indicate good or bad performance at the individual level.  Sales-related roles carry fundamentally different OTE structures which can vary significantly by the type of role.

LTI is not part of target earnings and is typically offered to higher performers starting at the mid-junior levels in the form stock grants, options, or cash vesting over 3-5 years.  HR guidelines indicate ~15% of yearly base provides a substantial "holding power" for the employee, but the percentages are typically much higher for key personnel and executives.  For senior personnel, the lack of LTI should be explored to ensure that it does not indicate a lack of confidence.

Sell enough stock to cover gains and income tax immediately on vest. If the stock price falls you are exposed to gains without the corresponding assets to cover.
