# manage career progression

## understand your career ladder
Most companies have a tech ladder, even if it's only one or two steps.  Domain-focused IC roles that can overlap with relatively senior managers from a compensation perspective.  Progression to the very top IC ranks is statistically rare.  

Given the compensation overlap, it's common for a person move back and forth between management and IC although it's not always successful; great engineers often make bad managers, and it's easy for managers to lose technical depth.  

| IC                       | Manager                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
|                          | Executive              |
| Fellow                   | SVP                    |
| Distinguished            | VP                     |
| Sr. Architect / Sr. Engr | Director / Sr Director |
| Advisor / Sr Advisor     | Manager / Sr Manager   |
| Early career             |                        |

*Place yourself on the tech ladder.  Identify the 5-year opportunities for uplevel roles in your current organization*

## choose an industry
Compensation for the identical applied skill can vary by an order of magnitude because:
- Industries value talent based on ROI of the applied skillset, which varies according to application
- Tech is notoriously high leverage; decisions a single worker makes can save (or cost) the organization many times the price of the worker themselves.

Because pay varies widely, jobs in tech are frequently tuned to optimize for work/life flexibility, particularly in industries where pay is uncompetitive.

Industry tailwinds are very helpful for entry level jobs, but hot industries can quickly become oversaturated with talent. Industry headwinds present opportunities for high performers because tech is nearly always challenged to innovate when cost optimizations are in play.  

Study your industry, adjacent industries, and adjacent geographies, understand where development money is being invested.  Read trade publications and quarterly reports of firms you are interested in.

*Assess developments in your functional area over the last five years and do an impact assessment on your skill set* 

## develop a goal
Identify a specific job that meets your criteria as "ideal" for you in five years.  If you have no specific job in mind, set a specific total comp and find jobs aligned to those earnings.  It does not need to include management, but should represent a substantial scope change from what you do today. 

Complete the following

In **year**, I would like to be **title** of **domain** in an **sized**-sized firm in **industry** in the **location** metro area , earning **range**, with a **number** span of control over **number** levels.

It should be aggressive but realistic, accounting for geography, current access, experience, and the time you are realistically able to commit to career development.   For example a high performing mid-career target hire might be able to achieve Director-level management in 5 years, where the same lateral hire might take 8-10 to achieve the same.

Get very specific, and look up listings for the exact job you want, and closely evaluate the hiring criteria.   Perform a gap analysis, and check your assumptions to make sure it's still aggressive but realistic.  

Pay special attention to market- and role-specific proof points.  For example, a global leader will need prior international experience, and a junior exec with multiple L1 managers will need to show strong performance as a direct manager.

## develop a plan

*Create a skills matrix showing the up-and downstream consumers of your function and assess your skills in each of these areas on a 100 to 400-level depth.* 

Start working the gaps:
- Access
- Technical experience
- Adjacent domain fluency
- Reputation
- Network
- Education

Do this exercise fresh every 6-12 months, like visiting your financial plan.

## maintain career agility
Average job tenure is 2-4 years and this holds true for your manager as well. If you are unable to identify a progression path in 18 months, quietly get your shit together.  Do not rely on your relationship with your manager for promotion or job security. Establish and maintain your own reputation for producing predictable, excellent deliverables, on time, with transparency to process.

A 2-4 year job cycle requires that you *maintain an active, documented offboarding plan* that allows you to transition your core responsibilities within 4 weeks. If you cannot hand over your work, you will be doing it until you quit or are fired.

*Join, attend, and present at meetups/user groups for your space.*  Talk to the attendees more than the vendors.   Find and develop relationships with mentors in your space; discussions should be 3:1 in favor of mentor sharing experience vs seeking advice.  

*How does your current role prepare you for your next two roles?*

## manage your earnings
The value of any skill depends on the market value of its outcome, which is subject to automation in tech/knowledge worker roles.  High-comp positions can get productized out of existence, sometimes gradually, often suddenly.  Do not spend to your earnings and maintain 6-12 months of opex relatively liquid to cover expenditures during a re-tooling.  This is much easier to achieve when you limit your future-obligated spending to less than half your net.  High levels of future-obligated spend reduces employment optionality, which can have substantial long-term impact on a career.

Know the pay structure for your role and those in your tech ladder.  In large firms, at entry/junior levels, total compensation is mostly base pay, with a 10-15% target bonus.  Senior ICs will see that rise to 25% and will be much higher as you move up mid- and senior- management.  Sales-related roles are fundamentally different base structure, and can be paid at different frequencies.

Sell enough stock to cover gains and income tax immediately on grant. If the stock price falls you are exposed to gains without the corresponding assets to cover.
