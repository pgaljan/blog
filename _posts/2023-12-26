# Introduction
EC2 Instance Explorer leverages the AWS EC2 bulk pricing API to permit a best-target selection of EC2 instances at any stage in the design phase.  I created it to allow me to quickly arrive at a 36-month price, so that it can be effectively compared to other consumption models.

It is designed to be leveraged via Excel query and paired with other data sources and sizers, however, there are several oppotunities to leverage this data for broad analysis and visualization.
