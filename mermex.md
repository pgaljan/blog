# Mermex

Mermaid enables diagram creation through a user-friendly text-based markup language, widely employed for real-time diagram generation within web interfaces. Additionally, it empowers system architects to automate diagram generation processes. [Mermex](https://github.com/pgaljan/mermex) is an Excel widget designed for the quick production of Mermaid markup language. It enhances diagram iteration by incorporating functionalities like titling and watermarking, facilitating convenient export and streamlined version tracking.

### Key features:
1. consistent format enforcement for fast authoring and re-authoring
2. loose hashing to quickly identify changed diagrams without referencing the output binary
3. Title and hash display within the diagram to trace iterations over time
