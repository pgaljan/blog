# Mermex

[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) facilitates diagram creation using an intuitive text-based markup language, extensively utilized for real-time diagram generation in web interfaces. It serves as a powerful tool for system architects, enabling them to automate the diagram generation process.

Visualization plays a crucial role in product development, as workflows and operational sequences need to be commonly understood by large and diverse engineering teams. Given the iterative nature of these diagrams during the development cycle, Mermaid's ability to render them directly from text into any one of the many rendering platforms available. 

It allows users to easily track versions without resorting to screenshots, saving off copies of files, or trying to roll back to snapshots of the graphing tool being used. Moreover, the programmatic nature of Mermaid offers the capability to incorporate unique watermarks directly into the diagrams, enhancing version control and providing an extra layer of customization within the visual representations.

[Mermex](https://github.com/pgaljan/mermex) is an Excel widget designed for authoring Mermaid flowcharts and sequence diagrams. It enhances diagram iteration by incorporating functionalities like titling and watermarking, facilitating convenient export and streamlined version tracking.  Additionally, Excel can take input from json or csv, allowing the consistent, error-free generation and iteration of very large Mermaid flowcharts.

### Key features:
1. consistent format enforcement for fast authoring and re-authoring
2. loose hashing to quickly identify changed diagrams without referencing the output binary
3. Title and hash display within the diagram to trace iterations over time
