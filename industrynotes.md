## 1. Tech Product firms
### Large firms (FAANG, HPE, Alibaba, Dell, etc)
Entry into large tech product firms is usually directly out of undergrad or graduate level intern programs.  Lateral entrants will usually come into the firm through the field (sales/service) or from acquisitions.  There is increasingly lower optionality for geography in large firms.  Laterals tend to hit glass ceilings at or around the executive level, but mid-senior IC and manager roles can be quite comfortable and stable.

### Mid-sized firms (Rubrik, NetApp, Pure, Veritas, etc)
Mid-late startups, pre-IPO and mid-sized tech firms in high growth phase represent the greatest opportunity for mid-junior technologists, particularly in field-facing roles, which tend to be more valued in these firms. They generally offer the least optionality in terms work-life balance, but high growth gives opportunity across geographies, and competitive pay ranges.  High performing laterals will have equitable access to executive positions, which can be parlayed to executive scope in a larger firm.

### Small firms 
These startups are generally low pay and highly volatile, but offer unparalleled technical exposure.  Junior laterals can get early leadership and decision-making experience, while retaining and expanding technical depth.

## 2. Consulting/MSP/Reseller/Distributor
The smallest firsm will focus on one area, but firms with 100+ personnel will generally feature "practices", each directed by largely autonomous business leaders who will determine the work culture.  There is opportunity across experience levels.  Mid-juniors with a history of high performance in this space are attractive to tech product firms as this is where their native recruiting class starts to wash out.

### Operations and Delivery
Junior laterals will find the most opportunity in operations/delivery roles, which also tend to be more geographically distributed.  These are excellent roles to get deep and broad experience, but tend to be lower paid because costs are passed more or less directly to the user.  Senior roles tend to be unpleasant, owing to the constant pressure to optimize.  People looking to maximize earnings and stability in later career phases will get their 10k hours and move on.

### Business and Offer Development
These are some of the most satisfying roles for a broadly interested technologist.  Even juniors can have extensive influence on technology stack and development pattern choices.

## 3. End user
End user firms will employ technologists to serve two functions:

### Enable key differentiators

### Support Operations
