# industry notes

## 1. Tech Product firms
### Large firms (FAANG, HPE, Alibaba, Dell, etc)
Entry into large tech product firms is usually directly out of undergrad or graduate level intern programs.  Lateral entrants will usually come into the firm through the field (sales/service) or from acquisitions.  There is increasingly lower optionality for geography in large firms.  Laterals tend to hit glass ceilings at or around the executive level, but this is offset by exec-level pay packages for senior ICs and mid-level managers.

### Mid-sized firms (Rubrik, NetApp, Pure, Veritas, etc)
Mid-late startups, pre-IPO and mid-sized tech firms in high growth phase represent the greatest opportunity for mid-junior technologists, particularly in field-facing roles, which tend to be more valued in these firms. They generally offer the least optionality in terms work-life balance, but high growth gives opportunity across geographies, and competitive pay ranges.  High performing laterals will have equitable access to executive positions, which can be parlayed to executive scope in a larger firm.

### Small firms 
These startups are generally low pay and highly volatile, but offer unparalleled technical exposure.  Junior laterals can get early leadership and decision-making experience, while retaining and expanding technical depth.

## 2. Consulting/MSP (Services) & Reseller/Distributor (Product)
The smallest firms will focus on one area, but firms with 100+ personnel will generally feature "practices", each directed by largely autonomous business leaders who will determine the work culture.  There is opportunity across experience levels.  Mid-juniors with a history of high performance in this space are attractive to tech product firms as the native recruiting class starts to wash out at the mid-manager level.  These firms can also be quite large;  success with a large span of control at these firms can allow for recruitment into any technology-adjacent firm at the executive levels.  Reseller/distributor roles offer very good commercial product exposure, but maintaining open-source expertise often requires a separate, mindful effort.

### DevOps, Deployment, Support
Junior laterals will find the most opportunity in these roles, which also tend to be more geographically distributed.  These are excellent roles to get deep and broad experience, but tend to be lower paid because costs are passed more or less directly to the user.  Senior roles tend to be unpleasant, owing to the constant pressure to optimize.  The transience offers a ton of opportunity for early-career people who can get their 10k hours and move into a more self-directed offer development or architectural role.

### Business and Offer Development
These are some of the most satisfying roles for a broadly interested technologist.  Even juniors can have extensive influence on technology stack and development pattern choices, and involvement in the presales end of of the value chain gives exposure to a very broad set of industries and technical problems, while being competitively compensated.

## 3. End user
Non-tech firms will employ dedicated technologists to either enable key technology-related differentiators, or to sustain necessary technology operations that cannot be outsources to an MSP.  The latter category experiences constant pressure from services and product firms, while the former offers lateral mobility as a subject matter expert in tech product and services firms and can be a satisfying career in its own right.  Compensation is aligned to the specific industry.
