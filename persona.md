# public persona
Have your resume drafted by a professional every five years.  Freshen it yourself or maintain a high level accomplishment list every six months.

A resume is wholly unreliable for communicating the full range of capabilities of a mid-junior or senior technologist, and can only hint at technical approach.  Maintain a blog or github that shows your current interests, skill levels, and development patterns. It does not have to be beautiful, but it should be functional, easy for a hiring manager to navigate, and indicative of your current skill set. The toolset should represent whatever is standard for the industry you are pursuing.

If you can't commit the time to an active blog or github (I can't), polish and publish a sprint's worth of work on carrd as a one-off.
