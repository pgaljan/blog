# public persona
Have your resume drafted by a professional every five years.  Freshen it yourself or maintain a high level accomplishment list every six months.

A resume alone is often inadequate to communicate operating level and can only hint at technical approach.  Maintain a blog or github that shows your current interests, skill levels, and development patterns. Projects do not have to be beautiful, but they should be functional, easy for a hiring manager to navigate, indicative of your current skill set, and built transparently in toolsets common in your industry.

If you can't commit the time to an active blog or github, polish and publish a sprint's worth of work on <a href="https://paulgaljan.com">carrd</a> as a one-off.
