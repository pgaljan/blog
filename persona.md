# prepare and maintain a public professional face
A resume is wholly unreliable for communicating the full range of capabilities of a mid-junior or senior technologist.  Maintain a blog or github that shows your current interests, skill levels, and development patterns. If you can't commit the time to an active blog or github, polish and publish a sprint's worth of work on carrd as a one-off.

Have your resume drafted by a professional.  Freshen it yourself every six months, and have it re-drafted every five years.
