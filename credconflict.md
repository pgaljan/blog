# credibility & conflict

### credibility
Develop a reputation for being predictable, knowledgeable, and easy to work with.  Show a basic respect for your colleagues who work alongside you, and an academic interest in adjacent domains.  Be clear in your requests and expectations of your colleagues.  When discussing a peer's domain, use their domain-specific lingo.  When discussing your domain, always begin with a first-principles overview, explicitly defining domain-specific terminology. 

Be mindful of your credibility in the workplace; what areas you are authoritative, advisory etc. Always have concrete, actionable deliverables when acting in an advisory role

Practice System 2 thinking frequently;  you do not always need to share the process, but you can use them in group or 1:1 environments to ensure that others have input into your analysis. 

Unreasoned opinions destroy credibility silently.   Any opinion should carry exec-ready backing analysis commensurate to its impact, or it should expressed as a question. Always identify the conditions and indicators that contraindicate your analysis. 

It is vanishingly rare to receive active feedback on incidents that damage your credibility in the workplace. It is much more common for people to exit an interaction thinking they’ve won an argument when in fact they’ve only identified themselves as an obstacle to be worked around (or removed entirely). Being retrospective and open, leaving room to be wrong.  Actively seek out feedback from everyone you work with closely.  Be specific in your request for feedback - ask for specific stops/starts/continues.

### managing ambiguity
Accounting for unknowns is a core aspect of analytic method and necessary for all management personnel, and most senior ICs.  Inability to account for ambiguity is immediately obvious to executives.

### conflict
Conflict is natural, necessary, and healthy in knowledge worker roles, but can be organizationally paralytic and personally off-putting.  This is solved with transparency and documentation.

When managing conflict with a peer, draw a network diagram of the workflow and document:
- RACI - if it does not exist, create one and agree on it.  If you cannot agree on it, consult your manager
- Areas of agreement
- Areas of conflict 
- Escalation paths
- Escalation timing

With those established, **use the entire time available to you** order to resolve differences, as long as you are making progress.  Give plenty of time between conflict resolution sessions, and make use of asynchronous methods to speed up the process.
