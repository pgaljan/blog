# credibility & conflict

### credibility
Develop a reputation for being predictable, knowledgeable, and easy to work with.  Show a basic respect for your colleagues who work alongside you, and an academic interest in adjacent domains.  Be clear in your requests and expectations of your colleagues, and be aware of their operational constraints.  When discussing a peer's domain, use their domain-specific lingo.  When discussing your domain, always begin with a first-principles overview, explicitly defining domain-specific terminology. 

Unreasoned opinions silently destroy credibility, and generally should not be expressed.  Make system 2 thinking and documentation a habit even if it's for your own consumption. Clearly identify the conditions and indicators that contraindicate your analysis, as well as any limitations you are aware of.  This helps ensure that you have exec-ready backing analysis commensurate to the position's impact. 

Collaborate well in multi-stakeholder initiatives by delivering concrete documentation and analysis.  Establish early what you will be delivering, and the timeline for doing so.  Avoid the temptation to slip into passive editor/reviewer role.  Use those opportunities to set the bar for what you will be expecting from your colleagues.

Being retrospective, open to feedback, and leaving room to be wrong are critically important to all mid-junior and senior roles.   Corporations are not built to deliver feedback to employees, so it can be vanishingly rare for mid-junior and senior personnel receive active feedback on incidents that damage their credibility.   Be aware of when power dynamics break the feedback loop, and actively seek out feedback from everyone you work with closely with structured retrospectives.

### ambiguity
Accounting for unknowns is a core element of analytic method and necessary for all management personnel, and most senior ICs.  Inability to account for ambiguity is immediately obvious and frequently irritating to executives.

### conflict
Conflict is natural, necessary, and healthy in knowledge worker roles, but can be organizationally paralytic and personally off-putting.  This is solved with transparency and documentation.

When managing conflict:

1. Identify stakeholders (n) and representatives (fewer than 4)
2. Draw a directed graph of the workflow or value chain and document:
- RACI - if it does not exist, create one and agree on it.  If you cannot agree on it, consult your manager
- Areas of agreement
- Areas of conflict 
- Escalation paths
- Escalation timing
3. With those established, **use the entire time available to you** order to resolve differences, as long as you are making progress.  Give plenty of time between conflict resolution sessions for representatives to sync with stakeholders, and make use of asynchronous methods to speed up the process.
