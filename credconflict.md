# credibility & conflict

### credibility
Develop a reputation for being predictable, knowledgeable, and easy to work with.  Show a basic respect for your colleagues who work alongside you, and an academic interest in adjacent domains.  Be clear in your requests and expectations of your colleagues.  When discussing a peer's domain, use their domain-specific lingo.  When discussing your domain, always begin with a first-principles overview, explicitly defining domain-specific terminology. 

Practice System 2 thinking frequently;  you do not always need to share the process, but you can use them in group or 1:1 environments to ensure that others have input into your analysis. 

Unreasoned opinions destroy credibility silently.   Any opinion should carry exec-ready backing analysis commensurate to its impact, or it should expressed as a question. Always identify the conditions and indicators that contraindicate your analysis.  Deliver concrete documentation and analysis in contributory or advisory situations; establish early what you will be delivering, and the timeline for doing so, and avoid the temptation to slip into passive editor/reviewer role.  Use those opportunities to set the bar for what you will be expecting from your colleagues.

Being retrospective, open to feedback, and leaving room to be wrong are critically important to all mid-junior and senior roles.   It is vanishingly rare to receive active feedback on incidents that damage your credibility in the workplace, and hubris is common across all experience levels.   Actively seek out feedback from everyone you work with closely.  Be specific in your request for feedback, asking for specific stops/starts/continues.

### ambiguity
Accounting for unknowns is a core element of analytic method and necessary for all management personnel, and most senior ICs.  Inability to account for ambiguity is immediately obvious and frequently irritating to executives.

### conflict
Conflict is natural, necessary, and healthy in knowledge worker roles, but can be organizationally paralytic and personally off-putting.  This is solved with transparency and documentation.

When managing conflict:

1. Identify stakeholders (n) and representatives (fewer than 4)
2. Draw a directed graph of the workflow or value chain and document:
- RACI - if it does not exist, create one and agree on it.  If you cannot agree on it, consult your manager
- Areas of agreement
- Areas of conflict 
- Escalation paths
- Escalation timing

With those established, **use the entire time available to you** order to resolve differences, as long as you are making progress.  Give plenty of time between conflict resolution sessions for representatives to sync with stakeholders, and make use of asynchronous methods to speed up the process.
